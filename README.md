# get-rich-quick

What to do: (Take a poo?)
- Read from items.json and call the method process_auctionhouse_file to calculate how many of each item you need to buy to craft e.g. mechano hog. Make this as cheap as possible, by for instance sorting the auctionhouse_row_id after the cheapest auctionhouse_price.
- Pull this shit into htdocs, not into your normal github folder you literall ape. You cant run php code from anywhere but your xampp control panel.
